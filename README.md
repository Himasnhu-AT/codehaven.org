## 🚀 Supercharge Your Coding Journey with AI-Powered Development

CodeHaven is an open-source, cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that leverages cutting-edge AI to revolutionize your coding experience.

## 🌟 About CodeHaven

CodeHaven is an innovative, AI-enhanced IDE that transforms your development workflow through intelligent code assistance and multi-model support.

### 💡 Motivation

In the world of development, tools like VS Code have become ubiquitous. However, they often rely on Electron, which can be heavy and large in size. This can lead to performance issues and a larger memory footprint. CodeHaven was created to address these challenges by providing a lightweight, fast, and AI-powered IDE.

By using Next.js, Tauri, Rust, and TypeScript, CodeHaven aims to deliver a seamless coding experience with advanced AI capabilities. It is designed to revolutionize the way developers code by offering intelligent code assistance and multi-model support. The goal is to enhance productivity, reduce errors, and streamline the development process through cutting-edge AI technology.

CodeHaven is more like nvim with a UI and AI capabilities, while being lightweight enough to run without causing a large memory footprint on your system.
